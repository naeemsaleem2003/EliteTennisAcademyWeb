To generate the text, you need to find the distribution of the next word given previous two words (or next character given the previous three characters). Then you need to **randomly** sample the next word/character based on the distribution (i.e., do **NOT** use greedy decoding, which is deterministically choosing the most probable unigram). After the word/character is sampled, append it to the current text and continue generating the next word/character. You need to repeat this process untill the current sequence **has 15 words/characters** (including prompts) or you **generate the &lt;/s&gt; token**.\n",
